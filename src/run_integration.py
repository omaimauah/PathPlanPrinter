Before you begin, make sure path_planning.py and PathPlanPrinter.py are accessible to your
script, by being in the same folder, or under your PATH environment variable.
    1. Import path_planning. You can use the reserved word as in order to create an alias.
    2. Copy and paste the auxiliary functions.
